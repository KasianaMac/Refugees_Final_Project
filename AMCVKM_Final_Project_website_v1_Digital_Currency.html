                    <article>
                        <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is located just a few miles off the Turkish coast. A European holiday
                            destination for decades, Lesbos has earned a new reputation as the first frontier of a humanitarian
                            crisis crashing ashore at Europe’s Mediterranean coastline. In 2016, 355,361 people crossed different
                            parts of the Mediterranean, seeking refuge in various countries across Europe. Many of them arrived
                            on Lesbos.</p>

                        <p>Once the refugees make it out of make-shift boats and dinghies, they are in need of food, water and
                            other assistance. Many are relieved to have made it onto solid ground, but are initially confused.
                            In an interview describing the situation on the ground in 2015, Javier Alvarez, Senior Leader
                            of the Strategic Response and Global Emergencies Team at MercyCorps, described the arrivals’
                            initial needs: “Immediately they need water, food, and some kind of health check. When they first
                            arrive, the first question many refugees ask is “Where am I?”, he said.</p>

                        <p>Once the refugees’ most immediate needs are taken care of, they are in need of a sustainable support
                            structure: food, clothing, hygiene products. Beyond these basic needs, the diverse backgrounds
                            of people arriving in Greece calls for a more flexible solution than the usual approach of setting
                            up tents, and handing out food rations and blankets.</p>

                        <p>“To meet their needs, we thought it would be best to let them decide what they need,” says Katia
                            Riddle, communications officer at MercyCorps. Instead of distributing these products directly,
                            MercyCorps decided to hand out cash assistance. The money was distributed electronically, and
                            could be accessed and transferred via mobile phones.</p>

                        <p>According to the World Bank, financial inclusion is on the rise, meaning that more people than ever
                            have some sort of access to an account in which to store, transfer and receive money. Mobile
                            phones have increased the amount of everyday tasks users are able to handle on the go, and financial
                            transactions are no exception.</p>

                        <p>Equally, refugees have become increasingly dependent on mobile phones, which serve as navigational
                            tools, access to advice online and as a window to family and friends back home. Not all refugees
                            arrive in their host country with a mobile phone, but in most situations they become an invaluable
                            tool for refugees across the world, including more convenient access to aid.</p>

                        <p>Despite the focus on Syrian refugees, those who arrive at European shorelines hail from a variety
                            of locations, from Afghanistan in Central Asia to West Africa’s Cote d’Ivoire. This diverse group
                            of arrivals has challenged traditional strategies of aid distribution, as refugees from different
                            cultural and geographical backgrounds have expressed different needs. For example, while some
                            prefer rice, others need flour to cook customary dishes.</p>

                        <p>“Twenty years ago there was a general feeling that it was better to give people commodities, like
                            blankets,” says Riddle. With its fairly developed infrastructure, Greece offered an ideal environment
                            to experiment, and offer refugees more agency. “It’s more humane and more respectful,” Riddle
                            says.</p>

                        <p>With the e-money, refugees were able to purchase whatever they felt they needed the most, as long
                            as it was available at the local stores. But it’s not only refugees who benefit. Rather than
                            shipping in products from abroad, local vendors were able to generate some revenue from the newly
                            arrived population. “It was kind of balm, to the community that was bearing a lot of the burden
                            already,” says Riddle.</p>

                        <p>According to Mastercard’s Center for Inclusive Growth, “mobile money and digital currency could transform
                            financial inclusion for refugees.” However, mobile money is not a panacea. In areas with limited
                            financial access and high levels of corruption, mobile money and digital currencies are either
                            impossible to implement, or simply miss the root of the problem.</p>

                        <p>“E-Money is better because it’s more exact and takes out the middleman,” says Riddle, meaning that
                            digital currency limits the element of human failure or interference and makes transactions easier
                            to track. In Nigeria, for example, MercyCorps decided to use e-vouchers instead. Their digital
                            nature helps with accountability, but the personal liberty given to refugees in Greece is lost
                            in the process.</p>

                        <p>Of course, Mastercard, Visa, and other credit card providers have a vested interest in the success
                            of digital currency and e-money. Almost all reports on aid distributed through digital channels
                            -- e-money in particular -- are sponsored by either of these major credit card companies. Introducing
                            refugees to mobile currency means introducing them to a brand, as well as the concept of banking
                            overall. “They have the same incentive in including them, as they have in including me and you:
                            they make some money,” says Riddle.</p>

                        <p>Critical voices mostly come from the ranks of local politicians. “We are always getting: How do you
                            know people are not spending it on cigarettes? What about terrorism?” says Riddle. Allowing refugees
                            to decide for themselves by handing out cash assistance is still a radical concept that raises
                            many concerns.</p>

                        <p>Local vendors, however, appreciate the mutual benefit of trading with refugees. “It’s not the beneficiaries
                            who are objecting to the system, it’s the people who aren’t on the ground seeing it at work,”
                            says Riddle. The traceability of digital transactions helps identify needs and refugee flows
                            on the side of aid agencies, and offers a level of oversight for sceptics of cash assistance.</p>

                        <p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile money has been vastly popular in countries like Kenya for over a decade.
                            Mobile money differs from mobile banking, in that it doesn’t require a bank account. Users trade
                            money directly through the accounts they have with their mobile service providers, almost as
                            if they were trading minutes. This is particularly practical for small amounts of money, and
                            has increased the number of people who participate in some type of banking system, especially
                            in regions where traditional banking branches are not accessible. </p>

                        <p>In Rwanda, the World Food Programme has been experimenting with different forms of mobile-based financial
                            assistance in three refugee camps. Despite its popularity in the general population, a lack of
                            accountability between payer and payee prevented the WFP from moving forward with a mobile money
                            program, says Mari Hassinen, Head of Programme Unit in Rwanda. “When you send an SMS to somebody,
                            you don’t get anything,” she says, while more traditional mobile banking systems provide both
                            parties with receipts. Rwanda is very hilly, which can lead to unreliable mobile connectivity,
                            which again may lead to disputes if a payment gets lost in the ether.</p>

                        <p>Instead of mobile money, WFP has partnered with the local Equity Bank to provide cash cards to refugees,
                            most of whom are from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, which are also accessible
                            through mobile phones handed out by the agency. The accounts are set up with an agent, and are
                            only accessible to those who are registered as refugees with UNHCR.</p>

                        <p>The banking agent collects personal information, including fingerprints, from their new clients.
                            These are used to authorize payments at the point of purchase, a system that adds security, according
                            to Hassinen. “When you have somebody’s phone, you can send money. You can’t take somebody’s thumb,”
                            she says. </p>

                        <p>Eventually, the WFP is hoping to create a virtual wallet for refugees that different aid agencies
                            can pay into. At the moment, no other aid agency in Rwanda has moved towards providing cash assistance
                            just yet. Just as in Europe, skepticism towards refugees’ spending habits is a deciding factor.
                            “Every agency has to go through the process of understanding: what does it mean to provide cash
                            instead of items?” says Hassinen. In the future, the WFP hopes that other aid agencies will join
                            them, helping their plan for a streamlined digital aid distribution come to fruition.</p>
