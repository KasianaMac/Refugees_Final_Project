                            </header>
                            <p> The Greek island of Lesbos is located just a few miles off the Turkish coast. A European holiday
                                destination for decades, Lesbos has now earned a new reputation as the first frontier of
                                a humanitarian crisis crashing ashore at Europe’s Mediterranean coastline. In 2016, 355,361
                                people crossed different parts of the Mediterranean, seeking refuge in various countries
                                across Europe. Many of them arrived on Lesbos. Once the refugees make it of make-shift boats
                                and dinghies, they are in need of food, water and other assistance. Many are relieved to
                                have made it onto solid ground, but are initially confused. In an interview describing the
                                situation on the ground in 2015, Javier Alvarez, Senior Leader of the Strategic Response
                                and Global Emergencies Team at MercyCorps, described the arrival’s initial needs: “Immediately
                                they need water, food, and some kind of health check. When they first arrive, the first question
                                many refugees ask is “Where am I?”, he said. </p>

                            <p> Once the refugees’ most immediate needs are taken care of, they are in need of a sustainable
                                support structure: food, clothing, hygiene products. Beyond these basic needs, the diverse
                                backgrounds of people arriving in Greece called for a more flexible solution than the usual
                                approach of setting up tents, and handing out food rations and blankets. “To meet their needs,
                                we thought it would be best to let them decide what they need,” says Katia Riddle, Communications
                                Officer at MercyCorps. Instead of assigning people some of the products they needed, MercyCorps
                                decided to hand out cash assistance. The money was distributed electronically, and could
                                be accessed and transferred via mobile phones.</p>

                            <p> Despite the focus on Syrian refugees, those who arrive at European shorelines actually hail from
                                a variety of locations, ranging from Afghanistan in Central Asia to West Africa’s Cote d’Ivoire.
                                This diverse group of people challenged traditional strategies of aid distribution. “Twenty
                                years ago there was a general feeling that it was better to give people commodities, like
                                blankets,” says Riddle. With its fairly developed infrastructure, Greece offered an ideal
                                environment to experiment, and offer refugees more agency. “It’s more humane and more respectful,”
                                Riddle says. With the e-money, refugees were able to purchase whatever they felt they needed
                                the most, as long as it was available at the local stores. But it’s not only refugees who
                                benefit. Rather than shipping in products from abroad, local vendors were able to generate
                                some revenue from the newly arrived population. “It was kind of balm, to the community that
                                was bearing a lot of the burden already,” says Riddle. </p>

                            <p> According to Master Card’s Center for Inclusive Growth, “mobile money and digital currency could
                                transform financial inclusion for refugees.” However, mobile money is not a cure-all. In
                                areas with with limited financial access and high levels of corruption, mobile money and
                                digital currencies are either impossible to implement, or simply miss the root of the problem.
                                “E-Money is better because it’s more exact and takes out the middleman,” says Riddle, meaning
                                that digital currency limits the element of human failure or interference and makes transactions
                                easier to track. In Nigeria, for example, MercyCorps decided to use e-vouchers instead. Their
                                digital nature helps with accountability, but the personal liberty given to refugees in Greece
                                is lost in the process.</p>

                            <p> Of course, Master Card, Visa, and other credit card providers have a vested interest in the success
                                of digital currency and e-money. Almost all reports on aid distributed through digital channels,
                                e-money in particular are sponsored by either of the major credit card companies. Introducing
                                refugees to mobile currency means introducing them to a brand, as well as the concept of
                                banking overall. “They have the same incentive in including them, as they have in including
                                me and you: they make some money,” says Riddle. </p>

                            <p> Critical voices mostly come from the ranks of local politicians. “We are always getting: How
                                do you know people are not spending it on cigarettes? What about terrorism?” says Riddle.
                                Allowing refugees to decide for themselves is still a radical concept that raises many concerns.
                                Local vendors, however, appreciate the mutual benefit of trading with refugees. “It’s not
                                the beneficiaries who are objecting to the system, it’s the people who aren’t on the ground
                                seeing it at work,” says Riddle. For the aid agencies themselves, the traceability of digital
                                transactions helps identify needs and refugee flows. </p>
