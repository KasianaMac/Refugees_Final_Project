                            <p class='lead'>Biometric data has made it easier than ever to register and track refugees. But what are the
                                downsides to a permanent digital footprint?</p>

                            <p>For Mati Afzal, 25, the road to Europe has been a long and dangerous one. Nine years ago, the
                                young Afghan man found a job as an interpreter for the U.S. army. He enjoyed the work, and
                                was content living in Kabul, where he grew up.</p>

                            <p>“When I was back in Afghanistan, I was working with Americans, and I had a very good job, very
                                good salary,” said Afzal. “I was very happy.”</p>

                            <p>But Afzal soon learned that in a country where the Taliban still wields a considerable amount
                                of influence and power, working for a foreign government like the U.S. could make him a target.
                                He began receiving threats from the Taliban. After two years, he stopped his job as an interpreter.
                                When Afzal decided that Afghanistan was no longer safe for him, he began looking for a way
                                to leave.</p>

                            <p>Afzal applied for a Special Immigrant Visa to come to the U.S. in the beginning of 2016 -- today,
                                his application is still pending. Eight months ago, he left in hopes of reaching Europe and
                                applying for asylum there. After months of being shuffled from one camp to another, in Bulgaria,
                                then Serbia, and then Hungary, Afzal finally arrived in Paris five days ago. But he is learning
                                that the digital footprint he has left with immigration authorities throughout his long journey
                                may have ramifications. </p>

                            <p>“The biggest thing for when people are tracked is of course, fingerprints,” explained Katie Kuschminder,
                                a postdoctoral researcher on migration studies at Maastricht University in the Netherlands.
                                “In the EU you’re supposed to be fingerprinted on arrival, and once your fingerprints are
                                in the Eurodac system, then it should be that any European Union country can access it.”</p>

                            <p>This means that when Afzal first arrived in Bulgaria, his fingerprints were collected and registered
                                in the Eurodac system. Now, no matter where Afzal tries to claim asylum in Europe, those
                                fingerprints will show where he first arrived. And under the EU’s Dublin Regulation, which
                                was adopted in 2003, Afzal can be sent back to Bulgaria by any of the countries where he
                                seeks asylum. </p>

                            <p>“Yesterday, I was fingerprinted in France, and they saw that I was already in Bulgaria,” said
                                Afzal. “Now, they may send me back to Bulgaria. I don’t want to go back, because I had a
                                very bad time in Bulgaria.”</p>

                            <p>The advancement of biometric technology -- or technology that tracks individuals by physiological
                                characteristics such as facial recognition, fingerprints and iris features -- has made it
                                easier than ever to register and track refugees quickly and effectively. UNHCR officially
                                began using biometrics to register refugees in 2010. In Europe, biometric identifiers are
                                widely used in travel documents, visas, residence permits, passports, and of course, in immigration
                                processing centers.</p>

                            <p>While there are many advantages for aid agencies and governments that use biometric data, there
                                are also downfalls, mostly tied to the ethical questions raised by this method of data collection.
                                In a paper for the journal Science and Engineering Ethics, lawyer Jeremy Wickens wrote about
                                the potential of biometrics to cause “social exclusion,” pitting the public interest against
                                the rights of an individual. Individuals of certain races, religions and backgrounds can
                                be disadvantaged by the biometric information collected on them.</p>

                            <p>In the case of refugees, biometric registration creates a permanent, digital footprint of these
                                individuals that will follow them for the rest of their lives. In Europe, few countries are
                                equipped to handle the high numbers of refugees seeking asylum. Even in Germany, where Chancellor
                                Angela Merkel has made a significant commitment to welcoming refugees, more than half of
                                the 97,275 asylum applications the country received in 2014 were denied. A digital footprint
                                limits asylum seekers’ mobility throughout Europe. Katie Kuschminder said that oftentimes,
                                migrants seeking asylum in Europe don’t realize how biometric registration can be used to
                                their detriment until long after they’ve arrived.</p>

                            <p>“It’s such an overload when [migrants] arrive, and you really have to envision that many people
                                have been through a terrible situation in their country of origin, they’ve survived, then
                                they’ve been on a boat without food or water, then they’ve been rescued. So when they get
                                to processing, they’re often not at all able to fully understand what’s happening,” said
                                Kuschminder. “I just think they’re in states of shock, and they’re grateful. But over time
                                there’s a lot of frustration.”</p>

                            <p>Kuschminder saw this frustration firsthand when studying Eritrean and Nigerian migrants in Italy
                                in 2014. Through extensive networks of fellow asylum-seekers, Eritreans in particular had
                                learned that giving their fingerprints to the EU would limit their options on where they
                                could seek asylum. Kuschminder said that these migrants would refuse to be fingerprinted
                                upon arrival in Italy, and choose to seek asylum in another country, where their biometric
                                footprint could not be tracked.</p>

                            <p>In Kuschminder’s study of the European migrant crisis in Italy, she observed that oftentimes,
                                immigration officials did not feel comfortable forcing refugees to get their fingerprint
                                taken at the border. This reluctance might be attributed to Europeans’ strong sense of a
                                right to personal privacy, a value that developed in response to the hierarchical societies
                                of the 17th and 18th centuries. In a 2004 article in The Yale Law Journal about the “two
                                Western cultures” of privacy -- that is, Europe and the United States -- professor James
                                Q. Whitman argues that what one sees in European continental law today “is the result of
                                a centuries-long, slow-maturing revolt against that style of status privilege.” Because much
                                of modern European society was shaped by efforts to dismantle the strict class structure
                                that existed a few centuries ago, most EU citizens today believe that all citizens -- from
                                no matter what social background they come from -- enjoy the same right to privacy. </p>

                            <p>Italy was criticized for allowing migrants to evade fingerprinting, and the EU eventually cracked
                                down on the registration system, establishing hot spots controlled by agents from Frontex,
                                the European border control office. Migrants cannot leave these hot spots until they are
                                fingerprinted. Kuschminder even said she’s heard of migrants being denied food until they
                                give EU border agents this information.</p>

                            <p>Patrick Vinck, who is the research director of the Harvard Humanitarian Institute, works with
                                aid agencies around the world to use big data in their research. He said that while privacy
                                is a basic human right that all people, including refugees, should enjoy, refuugees often
                                find themselves in a tough situation when seeking aid.</p>

                            <p>“The challenge is that for refugees to be able to access a number of services, they need to provide
                                information that would not necessarily be asked from any other citizen,” said Vinck. “In
                                order to get your voucher or cash credit, you need to let agencies have your iris scanned
                                or your fingerprint. When you’re a refugee you can’t say no, because saying no means you
                                can’t get the service.”</p>

                            <p>Privacy is not only a tenant of basic human rights, but also of European values. With policies
                                such as the “right to be forgotten” -- which allows citizens to request that negative information
                                about them be removed from the Internet -- Europe has distinguished itself as a stronghold
                                of personal privacy in the digital age, particularly in comparison with the U.S., where citizens’
                                expectations of personal privacy are lower. For asylum seekers in the EU, however, standards
                                are different. The hundreds of thousands of immigrants seeking refuge in Europe now know
                                that the road to asylum is long, and their information will be tracked every step of the
                                way.
                            </p>

                            <p>Mati Afzal knows he has given up his privacy as an asylum seeker in Europe. But he insists that
                                it’s a small price to pay, and that he has nothing to be afraid of. “I’m just in search of
                                a peaceful life,” he said. “Maybe if I was a criminal, giving up privacy would be an issue.”</p>
